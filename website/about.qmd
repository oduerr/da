### Internal Notes for the Author

#### How to add a new page


- Create a new quarto file in the root directory or subdirectory.
** DONOT `self-contained: true`:
Put the quarto-file in website directory (or subdirectory). 
Make sure that you do not have `self-contained: true` in the **qmd** file, otherwise file gets to large. Commenting it out is fine.

- Developing the new file


- Render and move to docs folder

```bash
quarto render _quarto.yml
```

- Check in the changes in the docs folder
