### Internal Notes for authoring the website

#### How to add a new page


- Create a new quarto file in the root directory or subdirectory.
Put the quarto-file in website directory (or subdirectory). 
Make sure that you do not have `self-contained: true` in the **qmd** file, otherwise file gets to large. An example is `website/lecture_notes/MCMC/MCMC.qmd`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
