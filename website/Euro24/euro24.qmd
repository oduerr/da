<!-- ![Bayes with Football](bayes.webp) -->

The Euro 2024 ⚽ is a nice showcase of Bayesian Statistics. In Bayesian statistics, probabilities are seen as a degree of belief, which fits well with the nature of football. Almost everyone has beliefs about the strengths and weaknesses of the teams before seeing any games (based on historical data) and then updates these beliefs as new data comes in (games have been played).


## Prediction based on the Historical Data

We load the matches prior to the Euro 2024, see <https://github.com/oduerr/da/blob/master/stan/Euro24/Euro_Data.md> how to get the data. Note the limitations of using historic; for example, Germany only started finding their form shortly before Euro 2024.


## Loading the data


```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
# Uncomment the following line to read the data for the Euro 24
data = read.csv('~/Documents/GitHub/da/stan/Euro24/games_before_euro24.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
data = data[,1:4]
colnames(data) = c('Home','score1', 'score2', 'Away')
#kable(data[1:3,])
```

Loaded `r nrow(data)` games with `r length(unique(c(data$Home, data$Away)))` teams.

## Preparing the data for Stan

```{r preparing_for_stan}
#Some R-Magic to convert the team names to numbers, no need to understand this
ng = nrow(data)
teams = unique(data$Home)
nt = length(teams)
ht = unlist(sapply(1:ng, function(g) which(teams == data$Home[g])))
at = unlist(sapply(1:ng, function(g) which(teams == data$Away[g])))

np=1 #Number games leaving out for prediction
ngob = ng-np #ngames obsered ngob = number of games to fit
#print(paste0("Using the first ", ngob, " games to fit the model and ", np, " games to predict.", "Num teams ",  length(teams)))
my_data = list(
  nt = nt, 
  ng = ngob,
  ht = ht[1:ngob], 
  at = at[1:ngob], 
  s1 = data$score1[1:ngob],
  s2 = data$score2[1:ngob],
  np = np,
  htnew = ht[(ngob+1):ng],
  atnew = at[(ngob+1):ng],
  s1new = data$score1[(ngob+1):ng],
  s2new = data$score2[(ngob+1):ng]
)
```
Using the first `r ngob` games to fit the model and `r np` games to predict. In total we have `r length(teams)` teams.

## A Model for the goals scored 🥅

We will assume that the number of goals scored by the home team $s_1$ and the away team $s_2$ follows a Poisson distribution. This has been shown to be a good model for the number of goals scored in a football match. We model the rate parameter $\theta$ of the Poisson distribution, related to the attack and defense strengths of the teams, as follows:

$$
	s_1 \sim \text{Pois}(\theta_1) \quad\text{goals scored by the home team}
$$
	
$$
	s_2 \sim \text{Pois}(\theta_2) \quad\text{goals scored by the away team}
$$ 

This is equivalent to performing two separate Poisson regressions, one for each team.

We assume that:

$$
	\theta_1 = \exp(\text{home} + \text{att}_\text{ht} - \text{def}_\text{at})
$$
	
$$
	\theta_2 = \exp(\text{att}_\text{at} - \text{def}_\text{ht})
$$

Since there is no home advantage in the Euro (except for Germany), we set $\text{home} = 0$.


### Prior for the attack and defence strength
In Bayesian statistics, we further need to specify a prior for the parameters (our degree of believe in the attack and defense abilities before seeing any data). For that we use a  hierarchical model with correlated parameters. Other models are investigated at [comp_premier_league](comp_premier_league.html) for the English Premier League 2019/2020 season and for the German Bundesliga [2000](comp_bundes_liga_2000.html) and [2024](comp_bundes_liga.html) where the hierarchical model have been especially successful. The model is adopted from the [blog_post](https://github.com/MaggieLieu/STAN_tutorials/tree/master/Hierarchical) and the [paper](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/16040/1/16040.pdf). We extend the model to include a correlation between the attack and defense strength of the teams, since it is quite reasonable that a team that scores many goals (is above average in offense) is also good in defense.

## Conditioning on the data / Fitting the model
After we state the model we fit the model to the data, or in Bayesian parlance, we update our degree of belief after seeing the data. 

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Details of the model MCMC sampling with Stan
The model is written in the probabilistic programming language Stan and can be found at <https://github.com/oduerr/da/blob/master/website/Euro24/hier_model_cor.stan>. This model used a Cholesky decomposition to model the correlation between the attack and defense strength of the teams. While this produces very effective sampling and is numerically stable, the Cholesky decomposition adds another layer of complexity to the model. We also provide a model without the Cholesky decomposition at <https://github.com/oduerr/da/blob/master/website/Euro24/hier_model_cor_nocholesky.stan> which is easier to understand but which is, besides the numerical difficulties, equivalent to the model with the Cholesky decomposition. 
 


```{r, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
library(cmdstanr)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
hmodel <- cmdstan_model('~/Documents/GitHub/da/website/Euro24/hier_model_cor.stan')
#hmodel <- cmdstan_model('~/Documents/GitHub/da/website/Euro24/hier_model_cor_nocholsky.stan')
hfit = hmodel$sample(data = my_data)
p1 = bayesplot::mcmc_rhat_hist(bayesplot::rhat(hfit))
p2 = bayesplot::mcmc_neff_hist(bayesplot::neff_ratio(hfit))
ggpubr::ggarrange(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```

The fitting of the model is good, as the Rhat values are close to 1 and we have no divergent transitions. The effective sample size is also good. 
:::

## The fitted model
We plot the means of the attack and defense strengths of the teams. Shown are the mean values along with the 25% and 75% quantiles. There is considerable uncertainty in the strengths of the teams, but that’s the nature of the game.



```{r, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidybayes)

# Step 1: Gather draws and calculate summary statistics with credible intervals
d = hfit %>%
  tidybayes::gather_draws(A[i, j]) %>%
  group_by(i, j) %>%
  summarise(
    average_value = mean(.value),
    lower = quantile(.value, 0.25),  # Lower bound 
    upper = quantile(.value, 0.75),  # Upper bound 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 2: Create a matrix of the average values
A = xtabs(average_value ~ i + j, data = d)

# Step 3: Plot the average values
plot(A[1,], A[2,], pch=20, xlab='Attack', ylab='Defence', main='Attack vs Defence')

# Step 4: Add team labels
text(A[1,], A[2,], labels=teams, cex=0.7, adj=c(-0.05, -0.8))

# Step 5: Add error bars for 66% credibility intervals
# Reshape data for plotting
d_wide <- d %>% spread(key = j, value = average_value)
d_lower <- d %>% spread(key = j, value = lower)
d_upper <- d %>% spread(key = j, value = upper)

# Convert to matrices for easier plotting
A_lower <- xtabs(lower ~ i + j, data = d)
A_upper <- xtabs(upper ~ i + j, data = d)

# Plot vertical error bars
arrows(A[1,], A_lower[2,], A[1,], A_upper[2,], angle=90, code=3, length=0.05, col="lightblue", alpha=0.5)

# Plot horizontal error bars
arrows(A_lower[1,], A[2,], A_upper[1,], A[2,], angle=90, code=3, length=0.05, col="lightblue")
```

## Detailed explanations for a single match Germany vs Scotland
The opening game of Euro 2024 was Germany vs. Scotland. In the plots below, we show the posterior probabilities for the attack and defense strengths of the teams. 

```{r, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=3}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidybayes)

# Function to calculate probabilities for a pairing
id1 <- which(teams == 'Germany')
id2 <- which(teams == 'Scotland')

# Extract posterior distributions for Attack and Defense
attack_germany <- hfit %>% tidybayes::spread_draws(A[i, j]) %>% filter(j == id1, i == 1) %>% select(A)
attack_scotland <- hfit %>% tidybayes::spread_draws(A[i, j]) %>% filter(j == id2, i == 1) %>% select(A)
defense_germany <- hfit %>% tidybayes::spread_draws(A[i, j]) %>% filter(j == id1, i == 2) %>% select(A)
defense_scotland <- hfit %>% tidybayes::spread_draws(A[i, j]) %>% filter(j == id2, i == 2) %>% select(A)

# Combine data into a tidy data frame
tidy_df <- bind_rows(
  attack_germany %>% mutate(Statistic = "Attack", Country = "Germany"),
  attack_scotland %>% mutate(Statistic = "Attack", Country = "Scotland"),
  defense_germany %>% mutate(Statistic = "Defense", Country = "Germany"),
  defense_scotland %>% mutate(Statistic = "Defense", Country = "Scotland")
)

# Include the mean values in the plot
ggplot(tidy_df, aes(x = A, fill = Country)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ Statistic, scales = "free") +
  labs(title = "Posterior Distributions of Attack and Defense Strengths", x = "Strength", y = "Density") +
  geom_vline(data = tidy_df %>% group_by(Statistic, Country) %>% summarise(mean_A = mean(A)), 
             aes(xintercept = mean_A, color = Country), linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() 
```
### Making predictions
We can now make predictions for the game Germany vs Scotland. Below are the first samples of the posterior distribution for the attack and defense strengths of germany and scotland.

```{r, message=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# Extract first five samples for demonstration
df = data.frame(attack_germany = attack_germany$A, defense_germany = defense_germany$A, attack_scotland = attack_scotland$A, defense_scotland = defense_scotland$A) %>% head() 
knitr::kable(df)
```



We use the samples for posterior row by row to sample the number of goals for Germany and Scotland. We can use the samples to calculate the probability of a win, draw or loss for Germany.

### Probabilities for win/draw/loss
```{r, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
 set.seed(42)
 theta_germany = exp(attack_germany$A - defense_scotland$A)
 theta_scotland = exp(attack_scotland$A - defense_germany$A)
 g_germany = rpois(length(theta_germany), theta_germany)
 g_scotland = rpois(length(theta_scotland), theta_scotland)
 
 
 
 # Alternative way to calculate the probabilities
 calc_prob <- function(observed, theta) {
     mean(dpois(observed, theta))
 }
 
 plot(table(g_germany)/length(g_germany), main='Germany Goals', xlab='Goals', ylab='Probability')
 prob_goals_germany = apply(matrix(0:10, ncol=1), 1, function(x) calc_prob(x, theta_germany))
 points(0:5, prob_goals_germany[1:6])
 
 prob_goals_scotland = apply(matrix(0:10, ncol=1), 1, function(x) calc_prob(x, theta_scotland))
 plot(table(g_scotland)/length(g_scotland), main='Scotland Goals', xlab='Goals', ylab='Probability')
 points(0:5, prob_goals_scotland[1:6])
 
 prob_goals = outer(prob_goals_germany, prob_goals_scotland, '*')
 sum(prob_goals) #Should be very close to 1
 
 print(paste0('Germany wins (simu) ',
              mean(g_germany > g_scotland), #Probability of Germany winning
              ' probs',
              round(sum(prob_goals[lower.tri(prob_goals, diag = FALSE)]),4)))
 
 mean(g_germany < g_scotland) #Probability of Scotland winning
 mean(g_germany == g_scotland) #Probability of a draw
 print(paste0('Draw (simu) ',
              mean(g_germany == g_scotland), #Probability of a draw
              ' probs',
              sum(diag(prob_goals))))
 
 print(paste0('Scotland wins (simu) ',
              mean(g_germany < g_scotland), #Probability of Germany winning
              ' probs',
              round(sum(prob_goals[upper.tri(prob_goals, diag = FALSE)]),4)))
```
Another way to look at is is at the joint distribution of the goals scored
```{r goal_plot, echo=TRUE, collapse=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# Define the function

  # Plot the joint probabilities with labels and different colors for outcomes
  d = df_joint %>% filter(df_joint$Goals_Team1 <= 5)  
  joint_plot <- ggplot(d, aes(x = Goals_Team1, y = Goals_Team2, fill = Outcome)) +
    geom_tile(color = "white", aes(alpha = Probability)) +

Remember the result? It was 5:1 for Germany, so quite unexpected by the model. 
So that these predictions with a grain of salt. The model is based on historical data and does not take into account the current form of the teams.
